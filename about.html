    <h1>My About Page</h1>
</table>
<p align="center">My name is Brandon Tran and I am attending the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island</a> and majoring in Computer Science.<br>
I am currently a sophomore and was previously majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I switched because I found biomedical engineering to be<br>
not as interesting as I had previously thought and found the courses to be too stressful, and I chose computer science because I find the idea of coding<br>
and creating my own programs to be both very interesting and practical in the real world.</p>
