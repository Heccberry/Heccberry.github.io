        <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Tran and welcome to my very first website!<br>
        There might not be too much in terms of content here as of now but I'm still learning the ropes and I plan to expand this site into something great!<br>
        I am very excited to learn more about this subject and I plan to use my programming skills to the best of my abilities.</p>
