        <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Tran and welcome to my very first website!<br>
            I am very new to computer programming but I am confident that I am capable of putting in the effort necessary to pass this class and<br>
            to learn as much as I can and to the best of my abilities!<br>
            I am very excited for what this subject has in offer for me and I am very optimistic in the practical skills I will be learning and how they<br>
            will help me in the long run in life and in my future career.</p>
