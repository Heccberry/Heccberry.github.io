        <p><h1>Hello, my name is Brandon Tran and welcome to my final CSC 106 project:<br>
            <strong>Ravenous Winston: The Anime, The Movie, The Game!</stong></h1>
    <h2> For this game I decided to create what is essentially snake but with a mild twist in tone.<br>
        Rather than play as a growing snake that eats fruit, you play as an incredibly angry Winston who's bent on chasing<br>
        down Oh Noes guy, cloning himself in the process and becoming an ever-increasing conga line of angry Winstons. Scary, huh?<br>
        The game also includes a built in tutorial screen that shows you the controls and instructions and even has a<br>
        lore button that takes you through a series of "cutscenes" that describe the comedic backstory behind Ravenous Winston.</h2></p>
