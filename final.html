        <p><h1>Hello, my name is Brandon Tran and welcome to my final CSC 106 project:<br>
            <strong>Ravenous Winston: The Anime, The Movie, The Game!</stong></h1>
        For this game I decided to create what is essentially snake but with a mild twist in tone.<br>
        Rather than play as a growing snake that eats fruit, you play as an incredibly angry Winston who's bent on chasing<br>
        down Oh Noes guy, cloning himself in the process and becoming an ever-increasing conga line of angry Winstons.<br>
        The game also includes a built in tutorial screen that shows you the controls and instructions and even has a<br>
        lore button that takes you through a series of "cutscenes" that describe the comedic backstory behind Ravenous Winston.<br>
        To play, use the arrow keys to change Winston's direction and collect as many Oh Noes guys as you can.
        If you hit the edge with 2 or more Winstons or if you collide with another Winston, it's a game over and you must restart the game.
        </p>
